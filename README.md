Roadside University is not an official or accredited institution of higher learning, but rather a term used to describe a form of informal education that involves collecting and reading pieces of paper found on the streets. The term was coined by a Nigerian writer, Kole Omotoso, in his opinion piece for The Guardian Nigeria News². He described Roadside University as an e-learning tertiary institution that teaches English and other subjects from random texts wrapped around food items sold by roadside vendors. He also mentioned that he was inspired by another professor who had a similar habit of picking up and reading every piece of paper he saw in the street. Roadside University is thus a creative and imaginative way of learning from the environment, but it is not a recognized or regulated academic institution.
